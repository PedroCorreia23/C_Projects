👋 Welcome to My C Projects Repository!
This repository is dedicated to projects built in C for learning purposes, data structures, and algorithms. Here, you will find various applications from library management systems to board game simulators and even a cryptography project. All of these projects utilize technologies such as GCC and Makefile. The projects are continuously being updated and improved.

🎲 Projects You Can Find Here:
🔠 Hangman Game: Test your vocabulary with this classic hangman game, right in your console! Can you guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn?
🧮 Basic Calculator: A simple but efficient calculator, that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

🚀 Getting Started
What You'll Need
- A C compiler (If you don't have one already, GCC or Clang are both great choices!)
- Git installed on your machine

Steps to Run the Projects:

1. 👯‍♂️ Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone <your-repository-url>

2. 🗂️ Navigate to the project directory
   cd <project-directory>

3. 🔨 Compile the project
   make

4. 🚀 Run the output file
   ./<your-executable-file>


That would be me, Zini!

Don't forget to replace `<your-repository-url>`, `<your-project-directory>`, and `<your-executable-file>` with your actual repository URL, project directory, and executable file name. And if you want to allow contributions, provide a link to your issues page where `<your-issues-link>` is.
