👋 Welcome to My C Projects Repository!
This repository is dedicated to projects built in C for learning purposes, data structures, and algorithms. Here, you will find various applications from library management systems to board game simulators and even a cryptography project. All of these projects utilize technologies such as GCC and Makefile. The projects are continuously being updated and improved.

🎲 Projects You Can Find Here:
🔠 Hangman Game: Test your vocabulary with this classic hangman game, right in your console! Can you guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn?
🧮 Basic Calculator: A simple but efficient calculator, that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
